# Quentin's MortarBoard Project

## About

I wanted to have a cool mortarboard for graduation. I wanted to make it easy for my family to see me. I wanted to prove that I learned _something_ while at college. When I 
discovered the wonders of the [relatively cheap RGB matrix panels][1] avalible on sites like sparkfun, I knew what I had to do.
